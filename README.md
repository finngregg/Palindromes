may be interpreted the same way in either forward or reverse direction

# palindrome.py 
A recursive function that calculates whether or not a string is a palindrome (reads the same if reversed)

# palindromeprimes.py 
Uses recursive functions to find all palindromic primes between two integers N, M, supplied as input. (start and end points are
included)

Examples: 212, 44, 9009, 4567654

It is assumed that N>1 and that Nâ‰¤M
